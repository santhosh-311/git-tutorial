Hello, this is an example text file about my git command based learning. Day1

when using git commit , there is an error occurring, but if git commit -m "some message" is typed, then there is no error.

Done with connecting the local repo with remote repo in GitHub. and the files from the local are visible on the remote repo.

Created a new branch using git branch command and used checkout command to move to this branch which is "copy1".

committed this branch and pushed it to the remote repo using git push --set-upstream origin copy1
